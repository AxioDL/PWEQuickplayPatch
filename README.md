# PWE Quickplay Patch
This is a Metroid Prime hack that integrates with Prime World Editor and Dolphin to enable a quickplay feature in the editor. It can also inject extra debug functionality into the game to assist mod developers.

To build, configure PrimeAPI and then edit build.bat and replace the `<DolPathHere>` line with a path to a Metroid Prime DOL file.
